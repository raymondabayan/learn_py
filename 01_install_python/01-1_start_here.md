# Install Python3
1. Install python3 (we will use python3.10 for this course) either through:
  * The official python website [[https://www.python.org]]
  * Through the anaconda distribution [[https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution]] (comes with python and anaconda software/package managers)
  * You can also use your favorite package manager if you are on linux or MacOS, but make sure you download python3.8 or greater
2. Make sure to add python3 to your `$PATH`. If you are using the official python installer or anaconda installer it should be an option that is on by default.
3. You can check your installation by opening a terminal or command line prompt and typing in `python --version` or `python3 --version`, which should output the version you have.
  * If you see an error, make sure that it was added to your `$PATH` and that it was installed correctly.

# Install a text editor
1. You can edit python scripts in any text editor, but some offer nice features such as syntax highlighting, error checking, autocompletion, and more. Here are some good free options (These should all work on Linux, MacOS, and Windows):
  * Visual Studio Code [[https://code.visualstudio.com]]
  * Sublime [[https://www.sublimetext.com]]
  * Emacs (Slower on Windows) [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html]]
  * Vim / Neovim (Tricky on Windows)
  * PyCharm (Free community edition, has less features than professional [expensive suite]) [[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/]]
  * IDLE (Comes with python)
2. Setup for basic python editing (mainly indentation) which should come standard in all above (except vim)

**Once you are all setup, feel free to start the next sections!**
