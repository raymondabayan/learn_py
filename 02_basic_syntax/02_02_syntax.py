# Everything after a '#' is not interpreted by python, and is treated as a comment*

These are useful for docstrings or explaining definitions.
The block comment ends at the closing three quote symbols.

Python is case-sensitive and indentation sensitive.
Indentation subsets lines into the parent function or block.
If the statement is not properly indented, the interpreter will complain.
