# Learn Python
## Overview
The goal of this project is to walk through the basics of python and build a simple program. No prior knowledge of programming in any language is necessary, but skip around as needed. Hopefully, one will be able to have a solid foundation in the core concepts which can be applied and extended as learning continues after. 

## Outline
1. Installing python
2. Basic python synax
3. Data types in python
4. Objects in python
5. Functions
6. The main function
7. Classes I
8. Classes II
9. Build

Go at your own pace and even if you don't remember the commands used, the important thing is to understand the core concepts covered. Also make sure to enjoy the process and I hope that you can build some really cool projects.
